# Project Name

Netlify Blog Starter.

## Description

This project was inspired by the great work [Josh Collinsworth](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter) has done with

But I wanted something more barebones I can use for clients
to get the base of the project up and running as quickly as possible.
